Todos App
=========

This is an example of the canonical "todos" backbone.js app that a lot of tutorials are built off off.

I felt that many of them only scratched the surface of how to actually construct a real project with backbone.js,
so here is my attempt at making the todos application structured like a real application might be, with
a build script, the JavaScript laid out in separate files, LESS templates for CSS, and minification of all static assets.

Feel free to use this as a starting point or inspiration for your application structures.
