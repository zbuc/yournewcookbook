Todos App
=========

This is a piggyback off of Jerome Gravel-Niquet's canonical "todos" backbone.js app that a lot of tutorials are built off off.

Jerome's app was very cool and showed lots of people how to actually write backbone.js code, but I felt that it only scratched the surface of how to actually construct a real project with backbone.js, so here is my attempt at making the todos application structured like a real application might be, with a build script, the JavaScript laid out in separate files, LESS templates for CSS, and minification of all static assets.

Feel free to use this as a starting point or inspiration for your application structures.
